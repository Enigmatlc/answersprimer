//Exercise 11.26: What type can be used to subscript a map ? What type does
//the subscript operator return ? Give a concrete example—that is, define a map
//and then write the types that can be used to subscript the map and the type
//that would be returned from the subscript operator.
//to subscrip a map we use a key_typeand a mapped_type is returned.

//map<int, string> mp{ {0,4} };
//mp[0]; would return a mapped_type of type int.
