//Exercise 11.13: There are at least three ways to create the pairs in the
//program for the previous exercise.Write three versions of that program,
//creating the pairs in each way.Explain which form you think is easiest to
//write and understand, and why.
//make_pair{ p1,p2 };
//{p1, p2};
//pair<int, int>pa{ p1,p2 };

//for this specific problem i prefer the second option since its straitfoward instead of having to calla class or create a new object.
