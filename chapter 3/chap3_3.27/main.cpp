//Exercise 3.27: Assuming txt_size is a function that takes no arguments
//and returns an int value, which of the following definitions are illegal?
//Explain why.
//unsigned buf_size = 1024;
//(a) int ia[buf_size]; illegal buf_size is not a const expr
//(b) int ia[4 * 7 - 14]; legal
//(c) int ia[txt_size()]; illegal txt_size() must be a const expr
//(d) char st[11] = "fundamental"; illegal: theres not enough space for the null terminator
