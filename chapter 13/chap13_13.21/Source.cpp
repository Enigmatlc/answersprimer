//Exercise 13.21 : Do you think the TextQuery and QueryResult classes
//need to define their own versions of the copy - control members ? If so, why ?
//If not, why not? Implement whichever copy - control operations you think
//these classes require. the class works as intended so we don't need to declare any of the copy members.
