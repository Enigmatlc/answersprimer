//Exercise 13.6: What is a copy - assignment operator ? When is this operator
//used ? What does the synthesized copy - assignment operator do ? When is it
//synthesized ?
//the copy -assigment operator is = it serves the same purpose as the one that is used with build in types but when it comes to user defined objects 
//the compiler provides the synthisized version for us if the the class doesnt provide one. it copies the members from one object to the other and it returns the left hand operand.
