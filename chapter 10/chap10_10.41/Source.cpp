//Exercise 10.41: Based only on the algorithm and argument names, describe
//the operation that the each of the following library algorithms performs :

//replace(beg, end, old_val, new_val); replaces the old_val in the ranged [beg,end) with new_val
//replace_if(beg, end, pred, new_val); replce with new_val if if fails the pred.
//replace_copy(beg, end, dest, old_val, new_val);	writes dest with the new version of the range [beg,end) if it fails the pred it replaces it with new_val
//replace_copy_if(beg, end, dest, pred, new_val); only replaces if it fails pred.
