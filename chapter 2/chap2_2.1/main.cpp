 * 2.1: What are the differences between int, long, long long,
 * and short? Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and
 * a double?
 */
/* short is usually to small so use int instead
 * int is normally is enough to hold most numbers, but if you need something bigger use long long
 *      unsigned is the same as unsigned int 
 *      signed is always positive
 * long is normally the same size as int
 * double is faster that float in some occasions, and its more accurate
