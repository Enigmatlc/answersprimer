//Exercise 6.1: What is the difference between a parameter and an
//argument?

//Arguments are the initializers for a function’s parameters. The first argument initializes
//the first parameter, the second argument initializes the second parameter, and so on.
//Although we know which argument initializes which parameter, we have no
//guarantees about the order in which arguments are evaluated (§ 4.1.3, p. 137). The
//compiler is free to evaluate the arguments in whatever order it prefers.
