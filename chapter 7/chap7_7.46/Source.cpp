//Exercise 7.46: Which, if any, of the following statements are untrue ? Why ?
//(a)A class must provide at least one constructor.
//false it no constructor is provided there will be a synthesized constructor provided by the compiler.

//(b)A default constructor is a constructor with an empty parameter list.
//false you can explicitly initialize every member of the class by using the parameter list in the default constructor.

//(c)If there are no meaningful default values for a class, the class should not
//provide a default constructor.
//Don't understand the question.

//(d)If a class does not define a default constructor, the compiler generates
//one that initializes each data member to the default value of its associated
//type.
//true the class will provide a synthesized constructor but only it no other constructor in provided
