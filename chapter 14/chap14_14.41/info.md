Exercise 14.41: Why do you suppose the new standard added lambdas?
Explain when you would use a lambda and when you would write a class
instead. Because it gets a little complicated when you have to create multiple function call operators in each class. Lambdas are easier to use when you have do to simple things like printing or using a simple conditional operator return but when things get more complicated you should go for a class function call operator overload instead.
