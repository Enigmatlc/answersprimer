Exercise 15.25: Why did we define a default constructor for Disc_quote?
What effect, if any, would removing that constructor have on the behavior of
Bulk_quote? because bulk_quote will be able to use its default constructor otherwise the synthesized default constructor wouldn't be allowed in bulk because it would be defined in disc.

error code when trying to create a Bulk_quote object using default constructor after deleting Disc_quote default constructor

the default constructor of "Bulk_quote" cannot be referenced -- it is a deleted function
