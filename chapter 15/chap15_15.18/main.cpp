// Exercise 15.18: Given the classes from page 612 and page 613, and
// assuming each object has the type specified in the comments, determine
// which of these assignments are legal. Explain why those that are illegal arenâ€™t
// allowed:
int main(){


    //Base *p = &d1; // d1 has type Pub_Derv legal

    //p = &d2; // d2 has type Priv_Derv //illegal:User code may use the derived-to-base conversion only if D inherits publicly from B. User code may not use the conversion if D inherits from B using either protected or private.

    //p = &d3; // d3 has type Prot_Derv//illegal: same reason as d2 we cant do a derived to base coversion if the access is private or protected.

    //p = &dd1; // dd1 has type Derived_from_Public legal

    //p = &dd2; // dd2 has type Derived_from_Private //illegal: we are still deriving from priv_derv which is is using the private access specifier for inheritance

    //p = &dd3; // dd3 has type Derived_from_Protected // illegal: same reason as d3
