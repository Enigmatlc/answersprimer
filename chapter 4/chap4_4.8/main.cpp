//Exercise 4.8: Explain when operands are evaluated in the logical AND, logical
//OR, and equality operators.
//The logical AND and OR operators always evaluate their left operand before the right.
//Moreover, the right operand is evaluated if and only if the left operand does not
//determine the result. This strategy is known as short-circuit evaluation
