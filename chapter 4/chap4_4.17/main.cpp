//Exercise 4.17: Explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment.

//There are two forms of these operators: prefix and postfix. So far, we have used
//only the prefix form. This form increments (or decrements) its operand and yields the
//changed object as its result. The postfix operators increment (or decrement) the
//operand but yield a copy of the original, unchanged value as its result
