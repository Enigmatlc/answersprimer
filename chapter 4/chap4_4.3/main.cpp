//Exercise 4.3: Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left
//undefined to give the compiler opportunities for optimization. This strategy
//presents a trade-off between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls in
//the use of the language by the programmer. Do you consider that an
//acceptable trade-off? Why or why not?

//It depends on much more the code will optimized compared to using operators that have defined order of operations.
