//Exercise 4.24: Our program that distinguished between high pass, pass,
//and fail depended on the fact that the conditional operator is right
//associative. Describe how that operator would be evaluated if the operator
//were left associative.

//finalgrade = (grade > 90) ? (grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass" : "high pass";
