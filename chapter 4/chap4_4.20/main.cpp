//Exercise 4.20: Assuming that iter is a vector<string>::iterator,
//indicate which, if any, of the following expressions are legal. Explain the
//behavior of the legal expressions and why those that arenâ€™t legal are in error.
//(a) *iter++;it increases the the object it iter points to by one using the postfix operator
//(b) (*iter)++;illegal: dereference operator is applied to the iter first then the value pointed to by the object is increased by one 
//(c) *iter.empty();ILEEGAL: *iter does not have a member named empty().
//(d) iter->empty(); same as (*iter).empty();.it calls the .empty() string member function.
//(e) ++*iter;ILLEGAL: cant increase a string
//(f) iter++->empty(); it increases the current object iter points to by one then it calls the empty() string member function
