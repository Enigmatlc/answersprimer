//Exercise 5.3: Use the comma operator (ยง 4.10, p. 157) to rewrite the
//while loop from ยง 1.4.1 (p. 11) so that it no longer requires a block. Explain
//whether this rewrite improves or diminishes the readability of this code.
//it does not improve the readability of the code, but it saves alot of space in the code.
