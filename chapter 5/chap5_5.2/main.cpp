//Exercise 5.2: What is a block? When might you might use a block?

//A compound statement, usually referred to as a block, is a (possibly empty)
//sequence of statements and declarations surrounded by a pair of curly braces. A block
//is a scope (ยง 2.2.4, p. 48).Compound statements are used when the language requires a single statement but
//the logic of our program needs more than one. For example, the body of a while or
//for loop must be a single statement, yet we often need to execute more than one
//statement in the body of a loop. We do so by enclosing the statements in curly
//braces, thus turning the sequence of statements into a block.
