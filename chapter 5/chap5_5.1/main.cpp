//Exercise 5.1: What is a null statement? When might you use a null
//statement?

//The simplest statement is the empty statement, also known as a null statement. A
//null statement is a single semicolon:
//;
//A null statement is useful where the language requires a statement but the
//program’s logic does not. Such usage is most common when a loop’s work can be
//done within its condition.
