//Exercise 5.8: What is a “dangling else”? How are else clauses resolved in
//C++?When we nest an if inside another if, it is possible that there will be more if
//branches than else branches.The question arises: How do we know to which if a given else belongs?
//This problem, usually referred to as a dangling else, is common to many
//programming languages that have both if and if else statements.
