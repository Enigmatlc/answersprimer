//Exercise 12.31: What difference(s) would it make if we used a vector
//instead of a set to hold the line numbers ? Which approach is better ? Why ?
//
//the numbers wouldn't be in descending order and we would have to call the sort algorithm to fix it. the better approach is to use a set to avoid having to do more work that is not necessary.
