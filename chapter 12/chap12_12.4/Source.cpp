//Exercise 12.4: In our check function we didn’t check whether i was
//greater than zero.Why is it okay to omit that check ?
//because we want to know if the vector is empty and we need to include zero to campare it with vector.size if we exclude when  i is 0 than we will never know if the vector was empty.
